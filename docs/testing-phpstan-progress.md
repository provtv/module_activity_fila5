# Activity Module - PHPStan Testing Progress

**Date**: [DATE]
**Objective**: Fix PHPStan errors in test files

---

## Current Status

### PHPStan Analysis
- **Total errors (before)**: ~800+ (including false positives)
- **False positives (`method.internalClass`)**: Majority of errors
  - These are Pest expectation methods called from outside Pest namespace
  - Normal and expected behavior for Pest tests
  - Can be safely ignored or suppressed

### Real Errors Fixed
1. **Type narrowing for null checks** ✅
   - Added PHPDoc type hints for variables that can be null
   - Added `toBeInstanceOf()` assertions after null checks
   - Affected files:
     - `Feature/ActivityBusinessLogicTest.php` (lines 193-214)
     - `Feature/ActivityEventSourcingTest.php` (lines 89-96, 196-204)

2. **Complex properties type safety** ✅
   - Improved type safety for JSON decoded properties
   - Added proper array type hints
   - File: `Feature/ActivityBusinessLogicTest.php` (lines 246-269)

### Test Quality Standards
- ✅ All tests written in Pest (not PHPUnit)
- ✅ NO `RefreshDatabase` usage (correct!)
- ✅ Tests use `DatabaseTransactions` or in-memory SQLite
- ✅ Tests follow business logic philosophy: **site works → tests validate reality**

## Test Files Status

### Feature Tests
- `Feature/ActivityBusinessLogicTest.php` - **FIXED** (type hints added)
- `Feature/ActivityEventSourcingTest.php` - **FIXED** (type narrowing improved)

### Unit Tests
- No unit tests present (feature tests cover business logic)

---

## Remaining Work

### PHPStan Configuration
- Consider adding `ignoreErrors` for `method.internalClass` in phpstan.neon
- These are false positives specific to Pest testing framework
- Example configuration:
```neon
parameters:
    ignoreErrors:
        - '#Call to method .* of internal class Pest\\Mixins\\Expectation#'
```

### Code Quality
- All real type safety errors have been addressed
- Tests now have proper PHPDoc annotations
- Type narrowing assertions added where needed

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pest + PHPStan**: Pest expectation methods trigger `method.internalClass` warnings
   - This is expected and can be suppressed
   - Focus on REAL type safety errors

2. **Type Narrowing**: PHPStan doesn't understand Pest's `not->toBeNull()` assertions
   - Solution: Add `toBeInstanceOf()` assertions after null checks
   - This helps PHPStan understand the type flow

3. **JSON Properties**: Laravel model properties that store JSON need careful handling
   - Add proper type hints before using
   - Check types explicitly (is_string, is_array)

---

## Next Steps

1. Apply same fixes to other modules
2. Create PHPStan configuration to suppress Pest false positives
3. Document pattern in testing-strategy.md
4. Run full test suite to verify all tests still pass
