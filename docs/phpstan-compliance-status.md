# PHPStan Level 10 Compliance Status


**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT (0 errors)

## Summary
The Activity module is already compliant with PHPStan Level 10 analysis. No errors were found during the verification process, demonstrating excellent type safety and code quality standards.

## Compliance Verification
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse Modules/Activity --level=10 --memory-limit=-1
# Result: [OK] No errors
```

## Module Overview

The Activity module provides:
- Activity logging system
- Event sourcing capabilities
- Audit trail functionality
- User activity tracking
- System event recording
- Activity report generation

## Best Practices Already Implemented

1. **Type Safety**: All methods have proper type hints
2. **PHPDoc Compliance**: Accurate documentation for complex types
3. **Event Sourcing**: Proper implementation of event patterns
4. **Activity Logging**: Type-safe activity recording
5. **Report Generation**: Clean implementation of report features

## Activity Patterns

The module follows strict patterns for activity tracking:
- Event-driven architecture
- Immutable event records
- Type-safe event handling
- Proper audit trails
- Performance optimization

## Key Features

### Activity Logging
- User action tracking
- System event recording
- Timestamp management
- Metadata handling

### Event Sourcing
- Immutable event store
- Event replay capabilities
